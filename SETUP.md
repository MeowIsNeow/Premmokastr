# Prema Moksha Astrology — Setup & Deployment Guide

A static astrology business website hosted free on Cloudflare (Workers static assets), with a blog powered by GitHub + Decap CMS. The site owner logs into `premamokshaastrology.com/admin` to write posts — no coding required.

**Total cost: ~$20/yr (domain only) vs. ~$260/yr on Squarespace.**

## ⚠️ Three edits required BEFORE uploading

**Edit 1 — `js/main.js` (lines 3–4):**
```js
const GITHUB_OWNER = 'your-github-username';   // was YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
const GITHUB_REPO = 'premamokshaastrology';        // was YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

**Edit 2 — `admin/config.yml` (line 3):**
```yaml
repo: your-github-username/premamokshaastrology    # was YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

**Edit 3 — `index.html` contact form access key** (see "Contact form activation" below — takes 2 minutes, but the form won't send until it's done):
```html
<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY">
```

## Deployment checklist

**Step 1: Create GitHub repo**
1. Go to github.com → sign up / log in
2. Click **+ → New repository**
3. Name: `premamokshaastrology` · Public (required for free Decap CMS)
4. Click **Create**

**Step 2: Upload files**
1. In the empty repo, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag in all files and folders (keeping the structure above)
3. Click **Commit changes**

**Step 3: Deploy to Cloudflare (Workers flow)**

Cloudflare has merged Pages into the Workers flow on most dashboards — the site deploys as a Worker with static assets. The included `wrangler.jsonc` file makes this work with zero build.

1. Go to dash.cloudflare.com → sign up / log in
2. Left sidebar → **Workers & Pages** → **Create application** (or "Create a Worker")
3. Choose **Continue with GitHub** → authorize if prompted → select the repo → **Begin setup**
4. Project name: anything short (it becomes your `.workers.dev` URL) · **Build command: leave blank** · Deploy command: keep `npx wrangler deploy`
5. Click **Deploy** → wait ~1–2 minutes → you get a URL like `https://<project-name>.workers.dev`

The `wrangler.jsonc` in the repo root tells Wrangler to serve the whole repo folder as static assets — no build step needed. Every push to `main` auto-redeploys the site.

**Step 4: Point the domain to Cloudflare**
1. In Cloudflare → your Worker project → **Settings** → **Domains & Routes** (or **Custom Domains**)
2. Click **Add custom domain** → type `www.premamokshaastrology.com`
3. In your current registrar's DNS settings, add a CNAME record: Host `www` → points to your `.workers.dev` URL
4. Add a redirect: `premamokshaastrology.com` → `www.premamokshaastrology.com`

**Step 5: Cancel Squarespace hosting**
1. Squarespace → Settings → Billing → Subscriptions
2. Cancel the Website plan (~$20/mo)
3. Keep the domain registration (for now)

**Step 6: Email forwarding (optional)**
1. Cloudflare dashboard → Email → Email Routing
2. Custom address: `hello@premamokshaastrology.com` → Destination: your Gmail

## Contact form activation (2 minutes, free)

The contact form uses **Web3Forms** — free up to 250 submissions/month, messages go straight to her email inbox.

1. Go to **web3forms.com**
2. Enter her email address → they instantly send an **access key** to that inbox
3. In `index.html`, find `YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` and replace it with the key
4. Commit the change — done. Test it by sending yourself a message.

## Languages (EN / PT)

- The site defaults to English; a **PT** button in the navigation switches everything to Portuguese (and remembers each visitor's choice).
- All Portuguese text lives in **`js/i18n.js`** — edit any string there to adjust wording.
- Blog *posts* themselves are written in whichever language she chooses in the CMS; the toggle translates the site's interface, menus, and buttons.

## Blog admin login — one-time OAuth setup (the one tricky step)

Decap CMS's GitHub backend can't complete the login by itself — it needs a tiny OAuth helper service (free, runs on Cloudflare). Until this is done, `premamokshaastrology.com/admin` will show a login button that leads nowhere.

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App:** github.com → profile → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → **New OAuth App**
   - Application name: `Prema Moksha Astrology CMS`
   - Homepage URL: your site URL
   - Authorization callback URL: `https://YOUR-HELPER.workers.dev/callback` (you'll know this after step 2 — come back and fill it in)
2. **Deploy the free auth helper:** use the `i40west/netlify-cms-github-oauth` Cloudflare Worker (search GitHub for it — it has a one-click Deploy button). Add your OAuth App's **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to it as secrets.
3. **Point the CMS at the helper:** in `admin/config.yml`, add one line under `branch: main`:
   ```yaml
     base_url: https://YOUR-HELPER.workers.dev
   ```
4. Visit `premamokshaastrology.com/admin` → **Login with GitHub** now works.

If this step feels fiddly, ask for help — it's ~15 minutes of copy-pasting values, and there are also hosted services (e.g. DecapBridge) that do the same job.

## How the owner writes blog posts

1. Go to `www.premamokshaastrology.com/admin`
2. Click **Login with GitHub** → authorize (one-time)
3. Click **New Post**
4. Fill in: Title, Date, Category, Body
5. Click **Publish** — the post goes live automatically in ~30 seconds

## Connecting the moving parts (after deployment)

The site is static, so anything involving payments, bookings, or email signups is handled by a free external service — you just paste in a link. All of these edits are in `index.html`.

**1. "Book Now" buttons → booking + payment**
- Easiest free combo: create a free **Cal.com** (or Calendly) booking page for each service, and a **Stripe Payment Link** or **PayPal.Me** link for payment.
- Then replace the `href="#"` on each Book Now button with your booking link.
- Alternative: simply point the buttons at `mailto:her@email.com` until she's ready for online booking.

**2. Newsletter Subscribe button ($5/week)**
- Budget-friendly options: **Buttondown** (free up to 100 subscribers, cheap paid tiers), **Substack** (free, takes ~10% of paid subs), or a **Patreon** tier at $5.
- Create the publication there, then replace the Subscribe button's `href="#"` with the signup page URL.
- Note: if she uses Patreon for the newsletter, it can double as the members area and the future classes host — one platform, one login for subscribers.

**3. Sample report PDFs**
- Create a folder called `reports/` in the repo (next to `posts/` and `images/`).
- Name the files exactly:
  - `reports/sample-natal-chart.pdf`
  - `reports/sample-transits-progressions.pdf`
  - `reports/sample-synastry.pdf`
- The Download buttons already point to these paths, so the links go live the moment the PDFs are uploaded. Until then, the buttons 404 — that's expected.

**4. Members area / classes**
- A truly private members-only area can't be done securely on a purely static site (anything in the site's code is visible to anyone).
- Recommended budget path: **Patreon** handles paid memberships, the newsletter, and class hosting in one place, and the site just links to it. The Classes section already says this.
- If she later wants real on-site accounts (login, members-only pages), that requires a small backend — doable, but it ends the $0-hosting model.

**5. Contact email**
- The address shown in the Contact section is `hello@premamokshaastrology.com` — search `index.html` and `js/main.js` for that string and replace it with her real address.
